Before start OPIE-SIM, it is necessary to  download the OPIE folder from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CauoKmcZVz8ygxqeyjnmjRB1opEsj9-O?usp=sharing 
and extract the essaydata. zip and backgroundsuppression. zip files from it to the OPIE-SIM filepath.


My_SIM_main. m is the main program. After opening it, you can locate the SIM dataset location by modifying the 'filepath'. The parameters that need to be modified are:
rawpixelsize = [65 65 100]; %  Camera pixel size/imaging system magnification 

NA=1.49;% objective NA 
Exwavelength=405;% excitation wavelength 488 561 638 668 


Emwavelength=525;% emitted light wavelength 525 610 665 680 


Numsteps=3;% number of sample phases 


NrBands=2;% coherent light quantity, for example, 2DSIM, S (k) and S (k ± p) bands are two, 3D, and three 


Numangles=3;% number of structural light directions


Readmode=2;% Data format: 1. paz 2. pza (OMX) 


readplane=1;%=1，If the sample only contains one Z-stack，or [1,5,9] to select Z=1,5,9
Among them, emwavelength will cause the algorithm to use different correction 3D-OTFs. If a special OTF is required, it can be generated by the PSF generator itself
